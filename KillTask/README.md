# Kill Task Script

This PowerShell script provides an interactive way to connect to a remote device, list running processes, and kill specific tasks. It is designed to help administrators manage processes on remote machines, particularly useful for killing common applications that may freeze.


# Features

-   **Interactive Interface**: Uses a loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input, allowing continuous interaction
 until the user decides to exit.
-   **Remote Device Connection**: Prompts for a device name or IP and tests the connection.
-   **Task Management Options**: Provides options to list common freezing applications, list all running processes, or manually kill a specific process.
-   **Error Handling**: Checks if the connection to the remote device is successful before proceeding.
